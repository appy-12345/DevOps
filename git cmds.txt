Creating, merging, and deleting branches in Git can seem overwhelming at first, but I’ll walk you through the steps from the very beginning. Here’s how you can do it using the command line, starting from a folder on your desktop.

### Step 1: Install Git (if you haven’t already)

1. **Download Git**: Visit the [Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and download the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).
2. **Install Git**: Follow the installation instructions. For Windows, make sure to select the option to use Git from the command prompt.

### Step 2: Set Up Your Local Repository

1. **Open Command Prompt (or Terminal)**:
   - For Windows, search for `cmd` in the Start menu.
   - For macOS, open `Terminal`.

2. **Navigate to Your Folder**: Use the `cd` command to change directories to your folder. For example, if your folder is on your desktop:
   ```bash
   cd Desktop/your-folder-name
   ```

3. **Initialize a Git Repository**: Run the following command to initialize a new Git repository:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

4. **Add Your GitHub Repository as a Remote**: Link your local repository to your GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/Apoorva-Practical/Practical.git
   ```

### Step 3: Create and Switch to a New Branch

1. **Create a New Branch**: Use the following command to create a new branch. Replace `new-branch-name` with your desired branch name:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b new-branch-name
   ```

   This command creates a new branch and switches you to that branch.

### Step 4: Make Changes and Commit

1. **Make Changes**: Add or modify files in your folder as needed.
2. **Stage Your Changes**: After you make changes, stage them for commit:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
   This stages all changes. You can also stage specific files by replacing `.` with the file name.

3. **Commit Your Changes**: Commit the staged changes with a message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   ```

### Step 5: Push Your Branch to GitHub

1. **Push Your Branch**: Send your branch and changes to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin new-branch-name
   ```

### Step 6: Merge Branches

1. **Switch to the Main Branch**: Before merging, switch back to the main branch (often called `main` or `master`):
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

2. **Merge Your Branch**: Merge the changes from your new branch into the main branch:
   ```bash
   git merge new-branch-name
   ```

### Step 7: Delete a Branch

1. **Delete the Local Branch**: If you want to delete the branch you just merged:
   ```bash
   git branch -d new-branch-name
   ```

2. **Delete the Remote Branch** (if needed): If you want to delete the branch from GitHub, use:
   ```bash
   git push origin --delete new-branch-name
   ```

### Step 8: Final Steps

1. **Push the Updated Main Branch**: After merging and deleting branches, push your updated main branch to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

### Summary of Commands

Here’s a quick reference of the commands you will use:

```bash
# Initialize a Git repository
git init

# Link to the remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/Apoorva-Practical/Practical.git

# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b new-branch-name

# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Your commit message"

# Push the new branch to GitHub
git push origin new-branch-name

# Switch to the main branch
git checkout main

# Merge the new branch into the main branch
git merge new-branch-name

# Delete the local branch
git branch -d new-branch-name

# Delete the remote branch
git push origin --delete new-branch-name

# Push the updated main branch
git push origin main
```

Creating a Git repository on your local machine is a straightforward process! Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you set up your first local Git repository.

### Step 1: Install Git

Before creating a Git repository, make sure you have Git installed on your local machine.

- **Windows**: Download and install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- **macOS**: You can install Git via Homebrew (if you have it installed) by running:

   ```bash
   brew install git
   ```

   Alternatively, you can download the installer from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
  
- **Linux**: Use your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can run:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install git
   ```

### Step 2: Configure Git

After installing Git, you should configure your username and email, as this information will be associated with your commits.

Open your command prompt (CMD) or terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

Replace `"Your Name"` and `"your.email@example.com"` with your actual name and email address.

### Step 3: Create a New Directory for Your Repository

1. **Navigate to the location where you want to create your repository**:
   
   Use the `cd` command to change directories. For example, to go to your Documents folder, you would do:

   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents
   ```

   Replace `C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents` with your desired path.

2. **Create a new directory**:
   
   You can create a new directory for your project using the `mkdir` command:

   ```bash
   mkdir my-project
   ```

   Replace `my-project` with the name of your project.

3. **Navigate into your new directory**:

   ```bash
   cd my-project
   ```

### Step 4: Initialize the Git Repository

Now that you're inside your project directory, you can initialize a new Git repository:

```bash
git init
```

This command creates a new subdirectory called `.git`, which contains all the necessary files for version control. Your directory is now a Git repository!

### Step 5: Add Files to Your Repository

1. **Create or add files** to your repository. You can do this using any text editor, or you can create a file directly from the command line. For example, to create a README file:

   ```bash
   echo "# My Project" > README.md
   ```

2. **Stage the files** you want to include in your first commit:

   ```bash
   git add README.md
   ```

   If you want to add all files in the directory, you can use:

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

### Step 6: Commit Your Changes

Now, commit your changes with a descriptive message:

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

This command saves your staged changes in the repository with the message "Initial commit."

### Step 7: Connect to a Remote Repository (Optional)

If you want to connect your local repository to a remote one on GitHub:

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub**:
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and log in to your account.
   - Click on the "+" icon in the upper right corner and select "New repository."
   - Name your repository (e.g., `my-project`) and click "Create repository."

2. **Connect your local repository to GitHub**:

   Go back to your command line and run the following command, replacing `<USERNAME>` with your GitHub username and `<REPOSITORY>` with the name of your GitHub repository:

   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<USERNAME>/<REPOSITORY>.git
   ```

   Example:

   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/Apoorva-Practical/my-project.git
   ```

3. **Push your changes to GitHub**:

   Finally, push your commit to the remote repository:

   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

   If your default branch is named `master`, use that instead:

   ```bash
   git push -u origin master
   ```
